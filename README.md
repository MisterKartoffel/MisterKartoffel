# Welcome!
I don't know why you're here. I don't know if I ever plan on making any significant project either.

These are the languages I<s>'m forced to</s> use.

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=misterkartoffel&theme=dark&bg_color=0d1117&hide_border=true&layout=compact)

But i can, like, <i>read</i> C. Don't force it, though.

## Why does this profile exist, then?
- To file issues on packages I use;
- To host my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MisterKartoffel/.dotfiles) remotely; and
- To hopefully learn something along the way.

## Ok cool, how does one talk to you?
If you're here, you probably got here through the link on my Discord profile. Go back.

If not, then... Discord. `misterkartoffel` is the username. Shocking, I know.
<!---
