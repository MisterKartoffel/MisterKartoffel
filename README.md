# Welcome!
This is me, currently a Chemical Engineering undergrad at an undisclosed university.

Here you'll mostly find my dotfiles and one or more overly convoluted Bash scripts that make me feel like a real programmer.


These are the languages I<s>'m forced to</s> use.

<sup>I always wanted a cool animated graph here.</sup>

## Why does this profile exist?
- To file issues on packages I use;
- To host my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MisterKartoffel/.dotfiles) remotely; and
- To hopefully learn something along the way.

## Ok cool, how does one talk to you?
You got two options, bucko:
1. You can always e-mail me, felipesdrs@hotmail.com is the way.
2. Through however you got here, if that's applicable.
